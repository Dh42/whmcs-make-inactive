# Make unpaid WHMCS Users Inactive

Since WHMCS changed their pricing structure to increase prices greatly I wrote this small python script to set users that have not paid and are not affiliate to inactive. 

## What It does 
The script uses the WHMCS api to query your users in a loop, if they have not generated any revenue and are not an affiliate, they are set inactive.
